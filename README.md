# Flight search central

After having entered the same flight information regularly into multiple flight meta search engines (strangely they all return different results) I wanted to have a way to enter the data once and then automatically open all pages prefilled with the data.

That's how the flight search central came to life as a simple HTML site that creates the URLs for the different meta search engines and opens them in new windows.

# TODO list

As usual, the list of things to do has a few items left that I hope to complete step by step:

* Implementations for the following flight search sites:
  * Kayak
  * Momondo
  * Skyscanner
  * KLM
* Store entered values in a cookie to load them the next time the page is opened
