# Flight search central

After having entered the same flight information regularly into multiple flight meta search engines (strangely they all return different results) I wanted to have a way to enter the data once and then automatically open all pages prefilled with the data.

That's how the flight search central came to life as a simple HTML site that creates the URLs for the different meta search engines and opens them in new windows.
